                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Vadim, and it probably says something about me that this paragraph was the last thing I did on this site. I was born in Uzbekistan (then the Soviet Union, just to date myself) and grew up in Moscow until my family moved to California when I was 10, where I have lived since. I went to school in Orange County before going to college at UCLA as a computer science major, following the typical video games->computers->CS major trajectory. Having realized what computer science actually is, I promptly changed my major to avoid being angry at commas and semi-colons all day.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a long time but it wasn't until I attended a coding bootcamp that I rediscovered my love for programming and logical problem solving. I have been happily coding since and look forward to picking up more skills and experience every week. In my spare time I run a fantasy football league with my friends, watch Formula 1 at stupidly early hours of the day, get frustrated by Liverpool's ability to constantly throw away wins, and try not to get too angry at the annual UCLA Football Inexplicable Lossâ„¢.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site was created with React using Browserify after spending about four days learning the basics of React. As a result things are sometimes... less than optimal due to me using the site as a chance to practice various rendering and data passing/binding techniques as well as just general messing around with neat code I've found elsewhere.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of that code comes from 3rd-party libraries and projects, which I included as practice in modifying and incorporating new code I had never seen before. Namely: <a style={linkStyle} href='http://stickerjs.cmiscm.com/' target='_blank'>Sticker.js</a> is used for the sticker effect on my picture in the sidebar which I have modified to show a flag underneath, <a style={linkStyle} href='https://github.com/akiran/react-slick' target='_blank'>React-Slick</a> port of Slick for the image carousels above and on the home page which I modified to be smooth auto-scrolling,&nbsp;
                            <a style={linkStyle} href='https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/11337835' target='_blank'>Mike Bostock's D3 animation</a> of a randomly traversed spanning tree which I have modified slightly and used for the background color change effect, and <a style={linkStyle} href='http://hakim.se/' target='_blank'>Hakim El Hattab's Rolling Links</a> effect which I have modified to match the icons in the sidebar and to work with React-Router.
